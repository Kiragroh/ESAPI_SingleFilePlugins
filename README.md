# ESAPI_SingleFilePlugins
Little selection of ready-to-go SingleFilePlugins for Eclipse that you have to try.

This examples contain helpful classes for ESAPI-beginner. In addition, some of them are really useful.

For instance: DVH-Export (universal) - all Plans
-> export all structures from all plans of a patient to .txt-file. This files can be much better processed for studies than the standard Eclipse-DVH-Export. Furthermore, you can maniupulate the DVH-Resolution with a script with is not possible for the Eclipse-Export.
